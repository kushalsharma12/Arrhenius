## What it is? ü§®

Arrhenius is a social earning and interactive climate change educational app. User will be able to post what they had done in a day to slow down the climate change and those posts will be integrated with their ETH Wallet address so anyone who feels that the user is doing a great work can send crypto to their wallet.
Now, whenever a user will get money in their wallet from someone, they will get values (like we get followers in Instagram) and those values will tell other users that he do good work to protect environment. 

## Philosophy üôÑ

The main idea is ‚Äì when you see on social networks like YT or IG where people start sharing content just for fun and now turned into big companies or finds their true passion.  
Same will happen here, these values will boost people's confidence that they can do something for the climate change.

## Also... üòè

Also, we are trying to implement interactive educational content related to climate change where user will learn about what small step she can take in a day to protect earth by interacting with Alan AI‚Äôs powered animal bots. 
Animal bots like polar bear bot & panda bot will try to tell user their stories that how they got affected by human‚Äôs misdeeds and what user can do to protect them. 
Alan will make the app smart and interactive. We will be using it in telling user the prices of ETH coin when she will be trying to make any transaction through their wallet. 
It will also be used to tell the latest climate news.
Twilio will be used for customer engagement. We will send emails and SMS to users by using Twilio‚Äôs API.
